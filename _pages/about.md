Hi! I'm Nency Dhameja, a Ph.D. candidate (ABD) in Econometrics and Quantitative Economics at Binghamton University (State University of New York).

My research interests include labor economics, applied econometrics, and computational economics. I use causal inference to study the effects of public policy on real-world outcomes. Iâ€™m especially interested in integrating language models (LLMs) into econometric and computational frameworks.
